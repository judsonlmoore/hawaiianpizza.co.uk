Skip the pizza delivery because you only need 6 basic ingredients to begin!</p> <p>This is my go-to pizza dough recipe. It was published on my blog 6 years ago and after making it for the millionth time, I decided it’s time for an update with a video tutorial and clearer recipe instructions. Plus, many of you said you want to conquer your fear of yeast this year! Consider this your starting guide and refer back to it often.</p> <p>(And if you’ve ever made homemade bagels or sandwich bread, you can easily make pizza dough because it’s quicker, easier, and requires less steps!)</p> <p>Pizza dough is the foundation and every great pizza begins with a great pizza crust. Some like thin and crisp pizza crust, while others prefer thick and soft pizza crust. This homemade pizza crust has it all: soft &amp; chewy with a delicious crisp and AWESOME flavor.</p> <p>Why waste the time when you can just buy frozen pizza dough? Frozen pizza dough is certainly convenient, but from-scratch crust has a delicious flavor and texture that only comes from homemade. Plus, most of the work is hands-off!</p> <h2 id="homemade-pizza-dough">Homemade Pizza Dough</h2> <p>All pizza dough starts with the same basic ingredients: flour, yeast, water, salt, and olive oil. Here’s the breakdown of what I use in my homemade pizza crust recipe. The full printable recipe is below.</p> <h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3> <p><strong>Yeast:</strong> I use Red Star Platinum yeast. I have the best results when I use this instant yeast. The Platinum yeast is fantastic because its careful formula strengthens your dough and makes making working with yeast simple. You only need 1 standard packet of yeast (2 and 1/4 teaspoons) to get the job done.<br /> <strong>Water:</strong> I tested this pizza dough recipe with different amounts of water. 1 and 1/3 cups is the perfect amount. Use warm water to cut down on rise time, about 100-110°F. Anything over 130ºF kills the yeast.<br /> <strong>Flour:</strong> Use unbleached all-purpose white flour in this recipe. Bleaching the flour strips away some of the protein, which will affect how much water the flour absorbs. You can substitute bread flour for a chewier pizza crust, but add a couple extra Tablespoons of water since bread flour contains more protein than all-purpose flour.<br /> <strong>Oil:</strong> A couple Tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil adds wonderful flavor to the dough. Don’t forget to brush the dough with olive oil before adding the toppings, which prevents the crust from tasting soggy.<br /> <strong>Salt:</strong> Salt adds necessary flavor.<br /> <strong>Sugar:</strong> 1 Tablespoon of sugar increases the yeast’s activity and tenderizes the dough, especially when paired with a little olive oil.<br /> <strong>Cornmeal:</strong> Cornmeal isn’t in the dough, but it’s used to dust the pizza pan. Cornmeal gives the pizza crust a little extra flavor and crisp. Most delivery pizzas you enjoy have cornmeal on the bottom crust!</p> <h3 id="description">Description</h3> <p>Follow these basic instructions for a thick, crisp, and chewy pizza crust at home. The recipe yields enough pizza dough for two 12-inch pizzas and you can freeze half of the dough for later.</p> <h3 id="ingredients-1">Ingredients</h3> <ul> <li>1 and 1/3 cups (320ml) warm water (between 100-110°F, 38-43°C)</li> <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons Red Star Platinum instant yeast (1 standard packet)*</li> <li>1 Tablespoon (13g) granulated sugar</li> <li>2 Tablespoons (30ml) olive oil</li> <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li> <li>3 and 1/2 cups (440g) all-purpose flour (spoon &amp; leveled), plus more for hands and surface</li> <li>sprinkle of cornmeal for dusting the pan</li> </ul> <h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3> <ol> <li>Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes. <em>If you don’t have a stand mixer, simply use a large mixing bowl and mix the dough by hand with a wooden spoon in the next step.</em></li> <li>Add the olive oil, salt, and flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 3-4 minutes (for a visual, watch me do it in the video above!). The dough can be a little too heavy for a mixer to knead it, but you can certainly use the mixer on low speed instead. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger – if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.</li> <li>Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray– just use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size. (Tip: For the warm environment on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150°F (66°C). Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When it’s doubled in size, remove from the oven.)</li> <li>Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C). Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you shape the pizza. Lightly grease baking sheet or pizza pan with nonstick spray or olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor. Highly recommended.</li> <li>Shape the dough: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. (If not making 2 pizzas, freeze half of the dough for another time– see freezing instructions below.) On a lightly floured work surface using lightly floured hands or rolling pin, gently flatten the dough into a disc. Place on prepared pan and, using lightly floured hands, stretch and flatten the disc into a 12-inch circle. Lift the edge of the dough up to create a lip around the edges. I simply pinch the edges up to create the rim. If using a pizza stone, place the dough directly on baker’s peels dusted with cornmeal.</li> <li>Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for a few minutes as you prepare your pizza toppings. I suggest pepperoni &amp; green peppers or jalapeño slices, extra cheese pizza, Hawaiian pizza, classic margherita pizza, spinach artichoke white pizza, or homemade BBQ chicken pizza.</li> <li>Top &amp; bake the pizza: To prevent the filling from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the top lightly with olive oil. Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Top with your favorite toppings and bake for 12-15 minutes.</li> <li>Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months.</li> </ol> <p>Source: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-pizza-crust-recipe/</p> <h2 id="how-to-make-haqaiian-pizza">How to make Haqaiian Pizza</h2> <h3 id="ingredients-2">Ingredients</h3> <ul> <li>1/2 recipe homemade pizza crust</li> <li>1/2 cup (127g) pizza sauce (homemade or store-bought)</li> <li>1 and 1/2 cups (6oz or 168g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li> <li>1/2 cup (75g) cooked ham or Canadian bacon, sliced or chopped</li> <li>1/2 cup (82g) pineapple chunks (canned or fresh)</li> <li>3 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled</li> </ul> <h3 id="instructions-1">Instructions</h3> <ol> <li>Prepare pizza dough through step 5, including preheating the oven to 475°F (246°C).
